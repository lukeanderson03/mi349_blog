            <p>Yesterday afternoon (Saturday, October 12), the Detroit Tigers lost to the Cleveland Guardians 7-3. The
                game started slowly with Tarik Skubal (Tigers) and Matthew Boyd (Guardians) pitching three shut-out
                innings. However, in the top of the fourth inning, Kerry Carpenter came in to pinch hit and hit a
                go-ahead, RBI single into right-center field. This scored Trey Sweeney from first base with a close play
                at the plate. Later in the bottom of the fifth, Tarik Skubal loaded the bases for the Guardians with one
                out. He faced Jose Ramirez who he hit with a pitch allowing a run to score. After, Lane Thomas came up
                to the plate. Lane Thomas proceeded to hit a grand slam, scoring four runs and giving the Guardians a
                4-run lead. This hit completely changed the vibe of the Tigers dugout and the outcome of the game. The
                Tigers never bounced back fully after this, scoring just two more runs while also allowing two more to
                the Guardians. Whatever momentum the Tigers still had was quickly put out when Emmanuel Clase came in to
                pitch against them in the ninth inning. He recorded a six-out save to secure the Guardians the series
                win and a spot against the Yankees in the ALCS. While this was a disappointing ending for the Tigers, no
                one had expected them to reach it this far. If the team adds a few players this offseason they have a
                real chance to be contenders in the playoffs next year.</p>

            <p>The Detroit Tigers are in the middle of one of the most improbable playoff pushes the MLB has seen in
                recent history. Back on August 10, the Tigers' were 10 games out of the playoffs. In other words, they
                had just a 0.2 percent chance to make the postseason. Since August 13, the Tigers finished their season
                with a 31-11 record, clinching a wildcard position over the Minnesota Twins. However, they were
                scheduled to play a three game wildcard series against the Houston Astros in Houston. The Astros had
                made the ALDS seven years in a row, and were favorites to win the series. The Detroit Tigers ended up
                sweeping them in the first two games, moving on to the ALDS to face the Cleveland Guardians. In game one
                of the Cleveland series, the Tigers were shutout and lost 7-0 in Cleveland. However, they bounced back
                and won the next game 3-0 thanks to a late-game three-run home run by Kerry Carpenter. As of today, the
                Tigers have traded their last two games to tie the series at 2-2. Tomorrow, October 12, the Tigers will
                play the deciding game in Cleveland and will have Tarik Skubal, this year's triple crown winner, on the
                mound.
