        <p>Hello! My name is Luke Anderson and I am the author/creator of this blog. I am 21 years olf and from Beverly
            Hills Michigan. I am a fourth-year student at Michigan State University studying Information Science with a
            concentration in human-centered technologies. I am interested in user experience, and have knowledge in
            front-end web development and mobile application development using Swift and Xcode. This blog was created
            for my web development class here at MSU as a project to work on our development skills. Here, I will make
            posts on a range of topics. These might include projects I’m working on, information I’m learning in my
            classes, or anything else I find interesting at the moment. As you follow along with this blog, you may see
            the website change as I will be working on it throughout the year for my class. Below, I’ve included a list
            of classes I’m taking this semester. Thank you for visiting my blog!</p>
